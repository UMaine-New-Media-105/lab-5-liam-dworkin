In lab #5 we are working on two projects. The first being a simple string of code that calls back a function for a red ball sprite. The sprite is then given boundary 
boxes along the X and Y axis by defining at which width and height it will no longer be allowed to continue traveling forwards. 

These variables define X constrictions:
  speedX = 3;
  directionX = 1;
  x = random(width);
  
These variables define Y constrictions:
  speedY = 3;
  directionY = 1;
  y = random(height);
  
  Link to part #1 and #2:

  (the sketch is the same for both sets of code and has been updated as such. Though the original part #1 code is available separate 
  from part #2 as two separate files in my personal lab 5 repository.)
